# Maps

This directory contains maps for the Nuggets game.
Feel free to add your own.

* `main.txt`: an interesting map for playing and testing.

* `fewspots.txt`: a map with too-few empty spots to support a game with 26 players and many gold piles.

* `small.txt`: a simple, small map; also too-few empty spots.
